>"*We conducted the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology to investigate the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology. The initial aim of the project was to repeat 193 experiments from 53 high-impact papers...*

>*However, the various barriers and challenges we encountered while designing and conducting the experiments meant that we were only able to repeat 50 experiments from 23 papers...This experience draws attention to a basic and fundamental concern about replication – **it is hard to assess whether reported findings are credible.***"
